    POS Kitchen Receipt Customization
    =================================

    This module extends the Odoo Point of Sale (POS) application, enabling businesses to customize kitchen receipt with advanced XML designs. It offers a solution for restaurants, cafes, and other food service establishments looking to enhance their kitchen order management and printing processes.

    Key Features:
    -------------
    * **Custom Receipt Designs:** Allows the creation of custom kitchen receipt designs using XML, providing flexibility in how receipts are formatted, what information is included, and the overall presentation.
    * **Direct Printing with jPosBox:** Integrates with jPosBox, bypassing the need for the IoT Box and enabling direct printing from Odoo POS to your kitchen printers. This ensures faster, more reliable receipt printing and supports a wide range of printer models.
    * **Enhanced Kitchen Workflow:** By customizing the layout and details of kitchen receipts, kitchens can improve order accuracy, speed up preparation times, and enhance overall service quality.

    Ideal for any F&B business looking to streamline their kitchen operations and provide a customized experience, this module bridges the gap between standard POS functionality and the unique demands of kitchen management.
